#Simulation codes of an activity-driven network model with two concurrent strains

Article: Activity-driven network modeling and control of the spread of two concurrent epidemic strains

The codes simulate an activity-driven network with two concurrent strains. The output of the code are two dimensional diagrams varying the per-contact infection rate of strain and the strain-specific re-infection probability

For ploting the coutour lines corresponding to the stability of the controlled systems please dowload the function getContourLineCoordinates.m from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74010-getcontourlinecoordinates
